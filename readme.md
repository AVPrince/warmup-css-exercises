Each of the exercise folders contains an image which you will mimic entirely in CSS. Each folder also contains an `index.html` file with a `style` tag (in the `head`) – this is where you will add your CSS. **Do NOT alter the HTML inside of the `body`.**

Unless otherwise noted, the DIVs are all 100px × 100px.
